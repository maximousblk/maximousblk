Studies show happiness is correlated to the [amount of free time you have](https://www.inc.com/jessica-stillman/5-research-backed-ways-to-feel-like-you-have-more-time.html).
Yet, if you ask someone how they're doing lately, more often than not you'll hear _"I'm busy"_. We live in a work-obsessed culture.

> According to the [Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/charts/american-time-use/activity-leisure.htm) annual Time Use Survey, Americans have on average **~5 hours** of free time per day.

It might not feel like you have 5 hours.
The truth is - you must be thoughtful and intentional with how you spend your free time.

One approach for prioritizing time which has worked well for me was defining my [hierarchy of needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs).
These are a guide for which aspects of my life require attention first. They also allow me to justify which items or services I'm willing to spend additional money on.

## Hierarchy of Needs

1. Family
1. Friends
1. Self-Care (food & diet, fitness, haircuts, massages)
1. Work
1. Freelance Work (development, videography)
1. Housekeeping (laundry, dishes, etc)
1. Professional Development
1. Projects ([dsmtech.io](https://dsmtech.io/), [personal site](https://github.com/leerob/leerob.io), [blog](/blog))
1. Videography ([travel videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZMli3czZnd1uoc1ShTouQw))
1. Music (listening, playing guitar)
1. Relax (movies, reading, happy hour)

## Exceptions

This guide isn't bulletproof - and it's certainly not set in stone. Occasionally, something will come up which will prompt a shift in priorities.
95% of the time, these rankings help me determine how to be intentional with my free time.

You probably have a mental list similar to this.
I encourage you to write down your hierarchy of needs and use them as a reference when pondering "What should I do tonight?".

You might find you have more free time than you imagined.
