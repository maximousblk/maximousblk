I've spent a lot of time in the past 4 months creating [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) apps for both work and personal use.

- I ported over my personal site from [Hugo](/blog/migrating-to-hugo) to [Next.js + MDX](https://github.com/leerob/leerob.io).
- I created [dsmtech.io](https://dsmtech.io/) (and explored using [Mapbox](/blog/using-mapbox-with-next-js)).
- A handful of projects at [Hy-Vee](https://innovate.hy-vee.com/) are being [rebuilt with Next.js](https://stackshare.io/hy-vee/hy-vee-aisles-online).

Along that journey, I've grown to really ‚ù§ Next.js and it's ecosystem. Here are some of the things I've learned along the way.

## CSS-in-JS

I used to be strongly against CSS-in-JS. If you didn't like CSS, then use SASS/LESS. _Why mix styling with your code_?

Well, turns out I was wrong. **Styling is code** and I have never felt more productive styling components than I do using CSS-in-JS.
Next.js comes preloaded with [styled-jsx](https://github.com/zeit/styled-jsx), which is fine, but I prefer [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/) üíÖ

## Font Loading

Performant font loading is much, much more difficult than I thought. I'm immensely grateful to Zach Leatherman for his
[Comprehensive Guide on Web Fonts.](https://www.zachleat.com/web/comprehensive-webfonts)
One approach I've taken is to use `@font-face` in combination with the `font-display` [attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@font-face/font-display).

This approach allows me prevent FOUT (Flash of Unstyled Text) but still has FOIT (Flash of Invisible Text). Yes, FOIT is undeserable, but thanks to Next.js my [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/)
performance score is still almost 100.

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: 'Fira Sans';
  src: url('/fonts/FiraSans-Bold.ttf');
  font-weight: bold;
  font-display: auto;
  font-style: normal;
}
```

Another approach I've used with Google Fonts is to include the `link` in the `Head` of my document.

```js:pages/_document.js
import Document, { Head, Main, NextScript } from 'next/document';
import React from 'react';

class CustomDocument extends Document {
  render() {
    return (
      <html lang="en">
        <Head>
          <link
            href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Fira+Sans:400,400i,700&display=swap"
            rel="stylesheet"
          />
        </Head>
        <body>
          <Main />
          <NextScript />
        </body>
      </html>
    );
  }
}

export default CustomDocument;
```

Becoming informed about all the different options and their tradeoffs has been a worthy investment.

## Dynamic Imports and Testing

It's likely that at some point in scaling your Next.js app, you'll want to use an external package
that doesn't work well server-side rendered. For me, this package was [react-select](https://react-select.com).

When SSR this component, it simply did not work in Safari. Until that bug is fixed, I needed a workaround. Thanks
to Next's [Dynamic Imports](https://nextjs.org/docs/#dynamic-import), it's easy to import a component and disable SSR.

```jsx
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic';

const ReactSelectNoSSR = dynamic(() => import('../components/select'), {
  ssr: false
});

export default () => (
  <>
    <Header />
    <ReactSelectNoSSR />
    <Footer />
  </>
);
```

While this works, we can go a step further and provide a [loading placeholder](/blog/loading-placeholder-with-sass) to make the user experience better.

```jsx
const ReactSelectNoSSR = dynamic(() => import('../components/select'), {
  loading: () => <Input />,
  ssr: false
});
```

Much better üéâ Now, how do we test it?

My preferred testing library is [Jest](https://jestjs.io/). The dynamic import support offered by Next.js **does not** expose a way to preload the dynamically imported components in Jest‚Äôs environment.
However, thanks to [jest-next-dynamic](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/jest-next-dynamic), we can render the full component tree instead of the loading placeholder. Perfect!

You'll need to add [babel-plugin-dynamic-import-node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-dynamic-import-node) to your `.babelrc` like so.

```js:.babelrc
{
  "plugins": ["babel-plugin-dynamic-import-node"]
}
```

Then, you can use `preloadAll()` to render the component instead of the loading placeholder.

```jsx
import preloadAll from 'jest-next-dynamic';
import ReactSelect from './select';

beforeAll(async () => {
  await preloadAll();
});
```

## MDX

My [portfolio](https://github.com/leerob/leerob.io) has transformed quite a bit since I started it in 2014. Originally, it was
just static HTML & CSS. Then, I [switched over to Hugo](/blog/migrating-to-hugo) so I could write my posts in Markdown.
This worked well for a while, but I wanted full control over my layouts and felt much more comfortable with JavaScript.
That's what led me to Next.js and MDX.

With [MDX](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx), I can use JSX components inside my Markdown documents with ease. This way, if I want to do
something custom, it's as simple as importing a React component. I've also started writing my presentations with MDX and [code-surfer](https://github.com/pomber/code-surfer) üèÑ

## Link Prefetching

For maximum performance, you can use the `prefetch` [attribute](https://nextjs.org/docs#prefetching-pages) on Next's `<Link>` component. This will give the perception
the page loads instantly. As of [Next.js 8](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-8/), `prefetch` uses `<link rel="preload">` instead of a `<script>` tag. It also only starts prefetching after `onload` to allow the browser to manage resources.

```jsx
<Link prefetch href="/">
  <a>Home</a>
</Link>
```

**Update:** Next.js 9 will [automatically prefetch](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-9#prefetching-in-viewport-links) `<Link>` components as they appear in-viewport. You no longer need to explicitly say `prefetch`.

## Polyfills

Next.js supports IE10 and all modern browsers out of the box using `@babel/preset-env`.
However, it's possible that your own code or external NPM dependencies might use features not supported in your target browsers. In this case,
you will need to add polyfills. This requires changes in a couple of places.

First, you will need to create/override your `next.config.js` file to customize Webpack.

```js:next.config.js
module.exports = {
  webpack: function (cfg) {
    const originalEntry = cfg.entry;
    cfg.entry = async () => {
      const entries = await originalEntry();

      if (
        entries['main.js'] &&
        !entries['main.js'].includes('./client/polyfills.js')
      ) {
        entries['main.js'].unshift('./client/polyfills.js');
      }

      return entries;
    };

    return cfg;
  }
};
```

Then, create `/client/polyfills.js` and include whichever polyfills you need.

```js
import '@babel/polyfill';
```

## Vercel

[Vercel](https://vercel.com) is hands down the **easiest way to deploy applications** I've ever used.
It's incredibly easy to get started and their GitHub integration will automatically deploy your app on pull requests and leave a link
for you to review the changes. If everything looks good, it will deploy to prod when the PR is merged. Simple as that.

The icing on the cake is how well the Vercel ecosystem works together. Their [domain service](https://vercel.com/domains) allows you
to buy domains _from the command line_. I've never been able to go from an idea to a live, deployed application
hosted on a domain so fast.

**Bonus:** I was even able to [setup email forwarding](https://spectrum.chat/zeit/now/redirection-email-domain~b5e1b613-ae92-42f9-bc49-e8c824a8a7f2?m=MTUzNDE5OTg3MzMwMw==) for my domain and create `me@leerob.io` using [improvmx](https://improvmx.com/) üéâ

## Where To Get Help

The Next.js and Vercel community support is _fantastic_. They're very responsive to emails, issues, or any other form
of contact. My preferred method would be [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/discussions). Thanks to Discussions, all
questions and answers are indexed, searchable, and easy to find. Their [tutorials](https://nextjs.org/learn/) and [docs](https://nextjs.org/docs) are also fantastic and well-written.
