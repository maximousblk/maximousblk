## Overview

[Unsplash](https://unsplash.com) is the largest source of high-quality images on the internet.
Amateur and professional photographers give back by allowing their photos to be used [100% free](https://unsplash.com/license) for commercial and non-commercial usage.

They also provide a [fantastic API](https://unsplash.com/developers), which gives you access to millions of photographs and a variety of metrics.
As an [Unsplash contributor](https://unsplash.com/@leerob), I wanted to see how many times my photos have been viewed and downloaded.

## Getting Access to Unsplash

To gain access to the Unsplash API, you need to:

- [Create an account.](https://unsplash.com/documentation#creating-a-developer-account)
- Go to [your applications](https://unsplash.com/oauth/applications).
- Click “New Application.”
- Accept the terms of usage.
- Fill in the required details.
- Retrieve the secret key for your new application.

**That's it!** 🎉 You now have access to make requests to the Unsplash API with your secret key.

## Creating an environment variable

To securely access the API, we need to include the secret with each request.
We also _do not_ want to commit secrets to git. Thus, we should use an environment variable.

Since I'm deploying with [Vercel](https://vercel.com), I can add the secret via their CLI.

```bash
$ vc secret add unsplash-access-token
```

To reference it locally when using `vc dev` it needs to be added to your `.env` file.

```bash
UNSPLASH_ACCESS_TOKEN=042d344
```

Finally, we need to add our new secret to `vercel.json`.

```json:vercel.json
{
  "env": {
    "UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY": "@unsplash-access-key"
  }
}
```

We can now reference the secret via `process.env.UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY` in our API route.

## Creating the API Route

Let's start by creating a new API route at `pages/api/unsplash.js`.

```js
export default (req, res) => {
  return res.status(200).json({});
};
```

To make server-side requests to Unsplash, we can install the [unsplash-js](https://github.com/unsplash/unsplash-js) library.

**Note:** `v7.0+` of this library has major breaking changes.

```bash
$ yarn add unsplash-js@6.3.0
```

Then, we can initialize `unsplash-js` inside our API route.

```js
import Unsplash, { toJson } from 'unsplash-js';

let unsplash;

export default async (_, res) => {
  if (!unsplash) {
    unsplash = new Unsplash({
      accessKey: process.env.UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY
    });
  }

  return res.status(200).json({});
};
```

Finally, we want to pull statistics for a given user and return the total number of downloads and views.

```js
import Unsplash, { toJson } from 'unsplash-js';

let unsplash;

export default async (_, res) => {
  if (!unsplash) {
    unsplash = new Unsplash({
      accessKey: process.env.UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY
    });
  }

  const userStats = await unsplash.users.statistics('leerob');
  const { downloads, views } = await toJson(userStats);

  return res.status(200).json({
    downloads: downloads.total,
    views: views.total
  });
};
```

## Example

The two cards below talk to `/api/unsplash` and pull back stats about my Unsplash account.

_Bonus_: You can cache the API route with the [cache-control](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cache-Control) header.

```bash
Cache-Control: public, max-age=120, stale-while-revalidate=60
```
