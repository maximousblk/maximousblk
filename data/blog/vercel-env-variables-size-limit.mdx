When trying to deploy a new API route with [Vercel](https://vercel.com), I stumbled onto this error.

```bash
Environment variables must not be greater
than 4kb when JSON-stringified (got 4.21KB)
```

I _love_ Vercel and use it for all my deployments. Thus, I had 12 different secrets. Unfortunately, there is an [upstream limit](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/platform/limits#environment-variables) on the size.

> The total size of environment variables is limited to 4kb. Deployments made with environment variables exceeding the 4kb limit will fail at the build step.

## Workaround

The root issue with the size of my environment variables was due to large `base64` encoded private keys from service accounts (e.g., Firebase, Google).

To work around this limit, we can **encrypt** our service account using [AES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard) encryption.
If you've never worked with encryption before, don't worry â€“ it's easier than it sounds.

## Storing Your Secrets

We _do not_ want to commit secrets to git. Thus, we should use an environment variable.
We can add secrets using the Vercel CLI.

```bash
$ vc secret add google-encryption-iv
$ vc secret add google-encryption-secret
```

To reference it locally when using `vc dev` it needs to be added to your `.env` file.

```bash:.env
GOOGLE_ENCRYPTION_IV=042d344042d34404
GOOGLE_ENCRYPTION_KEY=042d344042d34404
```

Finally, we need to add our new secret to `vercel.json`.

```json:vercel.json
{
  "env": {
    "GOOGLE_ENCRYPTION_IV": "@google-encryption-iv",
    "GOOGLE_ENCRYPTION_KEY": "@google-encryption-secret"
  }
}
```

We can now reference the secrets via `process.env.GOOGLE_ENCRYPTION_IV` and `process.env.GOOGLE_ENCRYPTION_KEY`.

## Encryption Example

Let's assume we have a service account like this:

```json
{
  "type": "service_account",
  "project_id": "...",
  "private_key_id": "...",
  "private_key": "...",
  "client_email": "...",
  "client_id": "...",
  "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
  "token_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/token",
  "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
  "client_x509_cert_url": "..."
}
```

One way to encrypt this value is by using an [AES Online Encryption Tool](https://www.devglan.com/online-tools/aes-encryption-decryption).

- Enter your unencrypted text (or select a file).
- Choose "CBC" mode.
- Key Size -> 128.
- IV -> random string of 16 characters. (_Save this_)
- Secret -> random string of 16 characters. (_Save this_)
- Output as `base64` and hit "Encrypt."

You should now have three values: IV, secret, and the encrypted output.
First, let's save the encrypted output to a file.
We will commit this to git and deploy it as part of our application.

Including the `base64` encrypted result with your deployed application is what reduces the size of the environment variable.
You now only need 32 characters to decode your service account.

Create a new file called `service-account.enc.js`.

```js
module.exports = { encrypted: 'BASE64_RESULT_GOES_HERE' };
```

Next, we need to create a function to decrypt the value.

```js
import crypto from 'crypto';

import { encrypted } from './service-account.enc';

const algorithm = 'aes-128-cbc';
const decipher = crypto.createDecipheriv(
  algorithm,
  process.env.GOOGLE_ENCRYPTION_KEY,
  process.env.GOOGLE_ENCRYPTION_IV
);

export const getDecryptedSecret = () => {
  let decrypted = decipher.update(encrypted, 'base64', 'utf8');

  decrypted += decipher.final('utf8');

  return JSON.parse(decrypted);
};
```

Finally, we can use this decrypted value inside of our API.

```js
import { google } from 'googleapis';

import { getDecryptedSecret } from './decret-secret';

const googleAuth = new google.auth.GoogleAuth({
  credentials: getDecryptedSecret(),
  scopes: ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube.readonly']
});

export default googleAuth;
```
