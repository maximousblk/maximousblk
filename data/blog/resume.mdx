Over the years, I've had many resume iterations. As I moved into my [new role](/blog/2019) last month, I went to update my resume ‚Äî That's when I realized it was terrible.

This is going to be a sort of _resume retrospective_. Basically, I'm just going to roast myself. Laugh at my mistakes and learn from my failures.

## 2016 Resume

This was my resume out of college which helped me land my first full-time engineering job. There were more resume iterations before this, obviously, but they were terrible.
Let me save _some_ dignity.

Okay, I'll start with the **good**.

- It's one page. The layout is clean and comfortable to read. Good job, Lee.
- The job title is more prominent than the employer.
- Most bullet points are useful (not too much content).
- Projects and GPA are still relevant because I'm fresh out of college.

What about the **bad**?

- This thing is written with [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/). Why? Because that's what everyone on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions) did. Talk about over-engineering.
- My middle name is not relevant. My name isn't that generic.
- My phone number is not needed. This trend persisted for a while.
- Some of the bullet points talk about _what_ I did instead of the _impact_ I made.
- "Videographer" is not relevant to the position I'm interviewing for.

## 2017 Resume

In 2017, I got the bright idea to re-design my resume. The content didn't change much.

  height={1244}
/>

There's some **good**:

- At a glance, you can quickly parse the content.
- Easy to read font.
- Education moved down now that I have a full-time job.

There are some **issues**, though:

- This custom Photoshop design did _not_ work well with Applicant Tracking Systems, or [ATS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applicant_tracking_system) for short. Which is, ya know, the whole point ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
- The location of the companies is not relevant.

## 2018 Resume

In 2018, [I switched jobs](/blog/joining-hy-vee). Time to dust off the ol' resume. But, just when you thought it couldn't get worse...

**I made this thing with InDesign**.

It had an embedded font. Well, it turns out the embedded font didn't work in Firefox. So the resume was basically unreadable in some cases.

  height={1245}

I don't have much good to say here, so let's just go straight to the **bad**:

- The about section is a complete waste of space. Save it for [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leejamesrobinson/).
- References are not needed on the resume.
- I'm not sure why I decided to drop the start and end dates from my work positions. "3 years" isn't very descriptive.
- The GitHub link is unnecessary. You can find it on my website.

## 2019 Resume

Brace yourself. We've now reached peak monstrosity.

I finally gave up on custom designs and opted to use a service called [Standard Resume](https://standardresume.co/). It was easy, required little maintenance, and worked much better with ATS.

Plus, I thought, let's add every single thing I've ever accomplished. I committed the ultimate sin. **I made a two-page resume.**

<Image

  src={`/static/images/resume/2019.jpg`}
  width={887}
  height={2187}
/>

Some things are **good**:

- The skills section made a comeback. ATS love those buzzwords.
- Some of the newer bullet points have excellent metrics.
- It's a wonderful design. Easy to read.

But others are **bad**. Really bad:

- I've been out of college long enough that I can drop the internships.
- Instead of putting freelance dev work, I put a project ([dsmtech](https://dsmtech.io)).
- GPA is not relevant anymore. Then again... was it ever relevant?
- Did I mention it's 2 pages? No one has time for that.

## 2020 Resume

That brings us [to now](/robinson-resume-2019.pdf). Behold, this single sheet of (digital) paper.

<Image
  alt={`2020 Resume`}
  src={`/static/images/resume/2020.jpg`}
  width={960}
  height={1243}
/>

I made this with Pages on Mac. No custom fonts. No crazy design.
I'd like to think it's the culmination of all the points made above.

- It's easy to update and maintain.
- The font is readable, and there's a good use of bold and italic.
- Unnecessary information is omitted (GPA, projects, internships, phone number).
- More relevant information is included (skills, freelance work).
- Industry normalized job title (Software Engineer III -> Senior Software Engineer).
- There are clear start/end dates with the same format throughout.
- Proper use of whitespace.

You don't need a two-page resume.
